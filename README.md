# Getting Started

* This Github repository (repo) holds information and files you will need to set up an air quality sensor. 

* There are three "walkthroughs" for you to use and they all located in the **"walkthroughs"** folder. 

  1. The first part of this project is to assemble, connect to, and update your Raspberry Pi Zero W. The **"Getting Started with Pi.pdf"** will guide you through this. This step is crucial as the Raspberry Pi is the "brains" of the air quality sensors
  
  2. Secondly, we will go through a few quick exercises of circuits and how to create software using the Python programming language. This "walkthough" is labeled **"LED Exercise.pdf"**
  
  3. You will then use the Raspberry Pi to connect to a pre-assemble set of sensors on a Pimoroni Enviro+ for Raspberry Pi. This will let us you measure air quality (pollutant gases and particulates), temperature, pressure, humidity, light, and noise level.  of sensors to monitor environmental conditions. The **Connecting Sensors to Pi.pdf** walkthrough guides you through this.
  
  5. Finally, the last walkthough, **Deploying Sensors.pdf**, helps show you how to deploy your AQS for monitoring.
  
  6. Processing the data is the last step. The **Processing Data.pdf** walkthrough will help you with this.
