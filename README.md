# Getting Started

* This Github repository (repo) holds all the information and files you will need to get your remote air quality station (AQS) working.

* There are three "walkthroughs" for you to use and they all located in the **"walkthroughs"** folder.

  1. The first part of this project is to assemble, connect to, and update your Raspberry Pi Zero W. The **"Getting Started with Pi.pdf"** will guide you through this. This step is crucial as the Raspberry Pi is the "brains" of the AQS.
  
  2. Secondly, we will go through a few quick exercises of circuits and how to create software using the Python programming language. This "walkthough" is labeled **"LED Exercise.pdf"**
  
  3. You will then use the Raspberry Pi to connect and control a variety of sensors to monitor environmental conditions. The **Connecting Sensors to Pi.pdf** walkthrough guides you through this.
  
  4. Finally, the last walkthough, **Deploying Sensors.pdf**, helps show you how to deploy your AQS for monitoring.
  
  5. Processing the data is the last step. The **Processing Data.pdf** walkthrough will help you with this.
