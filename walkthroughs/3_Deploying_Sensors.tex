\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Developing a Reasonable Question}

As defined in your prospectus, we need to ensure our research question aligns with our methods -- and our analysis prodedures, which is often a statistical test. 

\subsection{Testing Methods}

One effective way do to this is to collect preliminary data to ensure we will get reasonable results. 

\subsection{Creating Reliable Data Sources}

\section{Deploying the Pis}

We did not have the capacity to create a robust case for our Pis that might allow them to be deployed without exposure to the elements. 

Thus, here are some suggestions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Put the Pi and breadboard in a plastic sandwich bad and/or tupperware container. Make holes for the power input and the can PM sensor cable. 
  \item Put the sensor at where there is good air flow outside a wondow that you can provide power to the Pi. Or better yet, find a location outide where a power socket is available.  Note: the cable switch is not water proof, so be to protect the on/off switch; maybe put in a plastic bag too?
  \item Hopefully, the Pi still connects to your WiFi. If not, we'll have to come up with a method to launch the program on boot up. Work with Kyle if you have this issue, breifly we will 
  
\begin{itemize}
  \item Edit the rc.local file to include the path of your script that you want to run. In our case, it's whatever python file. The rc.local file is located at /etc/rc.local in nearly every Linux distribution. YES, the Pi's OS is Linux.
  \item Modify the Pi Configuration Utility and change the Boot option to: ``Boot To CLI''. That way, the next boot, it boots to the command line interface and runs the python script and if the program is a loop it'll keep running the script until you exit it.
  
\end{itemize}


\end{itemize}


\section{Collecting the data}

Once the data have been collected, you can extract the data from the SD card and copy to r for processing. 

\subsection{Processing the data}

Marc will be creating a script to process the data and allow you to create a nice dataframe to analyze the data.
